  birdDescription: ' A distinctive pheasant with bare red facial skin, a backward-pointing
    crest, and a vertically compressed tail. Males are iridescent black and silver.
    Females are grayish-brown. Coloration varies considerably throughout its range,
    with northeastern birds averaging the darkest. Occurs in forested areas, usually
    in hilly or mountainous regions. Overlaps with Silver Pheasant in the north of
    its range, with which it produces confusing intergrades. Native to South and
    Southeast Asia and introduced to the Hawaiian Islands of Hawaii and western Oahu.
    Males give a soft crow, other calls include low grunts and high-pitched squeals.'
