  birdDescription: A medium-sized tern with entirely white plumage, a slightly forked
    tail, and glittering inky pools for eyes. The bill is black with a blue base.
    Graceful and buoyant in flight. Breeds in trees and both natural and artificial
    ledges on coral islands. Sometimes flies very high in pairs or trios. Often seen
    offshore from boats, though most frequently encountered foraging over inshore
    waters.
