  birdDescription: " This \u201Coriginal chicken\u201D is smaller than its domestic
    descendants, and is widespread throughout South and Southeast Asia; can also
    be found as an introduced species in many regions around the world (especially
    prevalent on many Pacific Islands, including Hawaii). In its introduced range
    and some areas of its native range it has interbred widely with feral and domestic
    chickens, producing intermediate hybrids. Many of these birds cannot be distinguished
    from genuine wild-type birds. Within native range calls are useful for ID: the
    wild male\u2019s crowing is hoarse and choked off towards the end, unlike the
    loud, vibrant calls of the domestic rooster."
