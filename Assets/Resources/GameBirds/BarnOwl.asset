  birdDescription: ' Medium-sized owl with a heart-shaped facial disc and deep dark
    eyes; the only Tyto owl present throughout much of its range. Varies across a
    wide global range, but always note white-and-black speckling on the upperparts,
    beautiful gray-and-tawny wings, and large round head. Color of the facial disc
    and underparts varies from pure white to rusty orange. Hunts primarily rodents
    in open areas by night, foraging with a slow and buoyant flight. Roosts in old
    buildings, tree hollows, caves, and nest boxes by day. Its call is a bone-chilling,
    rising shriek.'
