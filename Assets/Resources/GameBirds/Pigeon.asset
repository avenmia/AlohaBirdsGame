  birdDescription: 'Fairly large pigeon with wild and feral populations throughout
    the world. True wild birds nest on cliffs and in caves from western Europe to
    central Asia. Pale gray overall with two bold black wingbars and iridescent purple
    and green on neck. Feral varieties are common in cities and farmland, often in
    large flocks. Variable plumage: some identical to wild-type birds, but can be
    completely black, white, or orangey-brown and any combination in between. '
