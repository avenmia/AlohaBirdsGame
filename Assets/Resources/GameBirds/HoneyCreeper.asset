  birdDescription: " A small Hawaiian honeycreeper of forests on Oahu. Males are
    bright yellow and females are grayer with two whitish wingbars. The bill is thicker
    and more curved than that of Warbling White-eye. Occurs in native and non-native
    forests, parks, and some suburban areas near mountains. Moves quickly among leaves
    and small branches in the understory and forest canopy in search of nectar, insects,
    and fruit. Song is a trill that does not change in pitch or speed. Call is a
    nasal \u201Cchee.\u201D"
