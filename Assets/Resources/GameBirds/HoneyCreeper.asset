  birdDescription: A bright red Hawaiian honeycreeper of high elevation native forests
    on Kauai, Maui, and Hawaii Island. Very rare on Oahu and Molokai. The brilliant
    crimson color and long, curved salmon-colored bill are diagnostic. Juveniles
    are mottled green, yellow, and orange. Very active and boisterous in the understory
    and forest canopy. Aggressively chases other birds from flowering trees. Vocalizations
    include a complex array of gurgles, chuckles, and reedy notes, more varied, lower
    pitched, and louder than those of the Apapane.
