## About the Project

**Hui Manu o Ku – Aloha Birds Game** is an AR experience that combines exploration and education. Users can discover virtual representations of Hawaii's native birds in their natural habitats, learn about their behaviors, and understand the importance of conservation efforts.

## Features

- **Augmented Reality Exploration**: Discover and interact with virtual birds in real-world locations.
- **Educational Content**: Learn about each bird species through informative descriptions and audio cues.
- **Interactive Map**: Navigate through different habitats and track discovered species.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Available on both Android and iOS devices.

## Technical Features
### 1. Login Screen
   - Users enter a unique username, securely stored locally to retrieve data in future sessions.
### 2. Map Scene
   - After login, users are directed to a real-time map centered on their current location.
   - Virtual bird pins, placed based on GPS data, represent real birds in Hawaii.
   - Users can rotate the camera view to explore surrounding birds in the environment.
### 3. Augmented Reality Scene
   - Tapping on a bird pin transports users to an AR scene with a 3D animated bird model.
   - Users can capture an image of the bird, which is saved to their personal gallery called the **Avidex**.
### 4. Avidex
   - A compendium of captured birds accessible from the map screen.
   - Users can browse bird entries, view facts, and revisit captured images.
### 5. Profile Screen
   - Displays user stats such as username, unique birds captured, total points, and bird capture count.
   - Includes an **AI Recognition Tool** allowing users to upload images of unidentified birds for automatic identification.
### 6. AI Recognition Tool

   - Provides a brief description of the bird for users to learn more about it.

## Future Features
Given more time, we plan to add:
* **Multiplayer and Leaderboard**: Compare points and bird captures with others.
